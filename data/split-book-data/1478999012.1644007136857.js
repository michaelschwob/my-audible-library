window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Unique and beguiling... Mason's first short story collection is a treasure trove of lush scene setting in faraway times and places, from the wilds of England to the Malay Archipelago... A perfect and fitting pick for these seemingly endless days when science, our understanding of reality and a faint longing for human connection are so irrevocably intertwined.\" (Alexis Burling, </b><b><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>A</b><b><i>&nbsp;Library Journal</i></b><b>&nbsp;Best Book of 2020</b></p> <p>On a fateful flight, a balloonist makes a discovery that changes her life forever. A telegraph operator finds an unexpected companion in the middle of the Amazon. A doctor is beset by seizures, in which he is possessed by a second, perhaps better, version of himself. And in Regency London, a bare-knuckle fighter prepares to face his most fearsome opponent, while a young mother seeks a miraculous cure for her ailing son.</p> <p>At times funny and irreverent, always moving and deeply urgent, these stories - among them a National Magazine Award and a Pushcart Prize winner - cap a 15-year project. From the Nile's depths to the highest reaches of the atmosphere, from volcano-racked islands to an asylum on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, these are tales of ecstasy, epiphany, and what the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> called the \"[S]truggle for survival...hand to hand, word to word\", by \"[O]ne of the finest prose stylists in American fiction\".</p>";
