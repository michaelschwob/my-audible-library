window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Seminal poems for moments of mindfulness.&nbsp;</p> <p>First published in 1923 and never out of print, <i>The Prophet</i> has been translated into over 100 languages and read by millions of people around the world. On the face of it, a simple book of 26 poem fables sharing one man’s wisdom. But <i>The Prophet</i> is so much more than that.&nbsp;</p> <p>It has inspired people from John F Kennedy to The Beatles and became the '60s Bible of counterculture – all because of the timeless truths it shared. Each poem takes a different theme – pleasure, beauty, freedom, joy and sorrow – as the fictional Al Mustapha shares his thoughts and experiences as he prepares to travel back to his island home. Even on first listen, his words will seem achingly familiar, having soaked into our collective subconscious:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Like a chain, you are as weak as your weakest link</li> <li>Love possesses not, nor would it be possessed</li> <li>Let there be spaces in your togetherness</li> <li>You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thought</li> <li>It is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked</li> </ul> <p>This collection makes the perfect bedtime listen or walking companion as you take time out from the world to consider your own truths and experiences, guided by the wise words and gentle hand of Kahlil Gibran.</p>";
