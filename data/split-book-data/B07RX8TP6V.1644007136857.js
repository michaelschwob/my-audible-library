Join him on a tour of the absurdities of modern life - from Ryanair to Richard III, <i>Downton Abbey</i> to phone etiquette, UKIP to hot dogs made of cats. Funny, provocative and shot through with refreshing amounts of common sense, <i>Thinking About It Only Makes It Worse</i> celebrates and commiserates on the state of things in our not entirely glorious modern world.</p> <p>Photo Credit: Chris Floyd, Camera Press London</p>";
