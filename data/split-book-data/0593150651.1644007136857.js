window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>What is your one thing? The entrepreneur, thought leader, and best-selling author of </b><b><i>Called to Create</i></b><b> offers a refreshing invitation: stop trying to do it all so you can thrive in your unique, God-given work.</b></p> <p><b>\"A compelling case for embracing our vocational limits and choosing to do our one thing well.\" (Emily P. Freeman, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>The Next Right Thing</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>Imagine how different your life would be if you spent your time doing the very thing that brings you the greatest joy. It’s possible, but most people spend their days making incremental advances on numerous tasks, competent at many things but exceptional at none. That’s because for too long we’ve believed the lie that more activity, more jobs, and more responsibility equals greater effectiveness. In short, we are becoming a society of \"jacks-and-jills-of-all-trades and masters of none.\"</p> <p>But what if you could shift your focus from too many things to one?</p> <p>In this thought-provoking audiobook, you’ll discover the exponential power of pursuing a singular craft. Through practical principles, Jordan Raynor provides straightforward steps for finding and thriving in your calling. He also highlights more than a dozen real-life examples of high-impact individuals who have chosen to focus on and excel in their unique gifting, including:</p> <ul> <li><i>Chronicles of Narnia</i> author C. S. Lewis</li> <li>Enron whistle-blower Sherron Watkins</li> <li>TV legend Mister Rogers</li> <li>Dallas Mavericks CEO Cynthia Marshall</li> <li>Reality TV star Chip Gaines</li> <li>NFL Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy</li> <li>Biblical figures, a teacher, a pilot, a banker, and world-class entrepreneurs</li> </ul> <p>Too many of us are overwhelmed, overcommitted, and overstressed. This audiobook offers a better way - the path to becoming a master of one!</p>";
