window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Most people think the way to write a best seller is to have a lot of talent and even more luck. As you will learn, there is a recipe for success, and luck may be the least important ingredient in creating a best seller.&nbsp;</p> <p>When it comes to solving the mystery of what makes a best-selling novel, no one has cracked the code better than James Scott Bell. A best-selling author himself, winner of the International Thriller Writers Award and the Christy Award for Suspense, plus the author of the number-one best seller for writers, <i>Plot &amp; Structure</i>, Mr. Bell has been teaching the principles of best-selling fiction for over 20 years, principles that apply to any genre or style.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the 24 lectures of <i>How to Write Best-Selling Fiction</i>, Mr. Bell provides a comprehensive, eye-opening, and illuminating survey of the entire writing process, as well as a full breakdown of how best-selling authors such as Stephen King, Dean Koontz, Michael Connelly, Suzanne Collins, Janet Evanovich, and dozens of others have implemented best practices in their own writing.&nbsp;</p> <p>From fun creative challenges to help you get started with unique plot and character ideas to how to format, package, and promote your finished material - with help dotting every \"i\" and crossing every \"t\" along the way - Mr. Bell offers an insightful, intimate, and extraordinarily revealing look at the elements that elevate a novel to become a best seller. Any aspiring author will gain a wealth of tools that will not only improve their ability to write, but will also increase their enjoyment of the craft.&nbsp;</p> <p>The famous writer Somerset Maugham once said, “There are three rules for writing a novel. Unfortunately, no one knows what they are.” And maybe no one knows the “rules”, but there are writing techniques, practices, and fundamentals that writers have used for decades to become best-selling authors. And just like Picasso, once you master the basics of your art, then you can create your own rules. With <i>How to Write Best-Selling Fiction</i>, you get an intimate introduction to the fundamentals of how to write your best seller, from a best-selling author who has mastered the secrets to success.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
