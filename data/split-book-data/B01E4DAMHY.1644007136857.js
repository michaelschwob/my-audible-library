window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this landmark book of interfaith dialogue, the Dalai Lama provides an extraordinary Buddhist perspective on the teachings of Jesus, commenting on well-known passages from the four Christian Gospels including the Sermon on the Mount, the parable of the mustard seed, the Resurrection, and others. Drawing parallels between Jesus and the Buddha - and the rich traditions from which they hail - His Holiness delivers a profound affirmation of the sacred in all religions. Listeners will be inspired by the Dalai Lama's discussion of the endless merits of each tradition and uplifted by the common humanity between them. </p> <p>Cover photograph by Jeremy Russell </p>";
