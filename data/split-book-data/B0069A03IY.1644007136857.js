window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Emmy Award-winning actor Martin Sheen (<i>The West Wing</i>) lends his distinguished voice to this stirring call to move beyond religion for the guidance to improve human life on individual, community, and global levels, including a guided meditation practice for cultivating key human values.</p> <p>Ten years ago, in his best-selling <i>Ethics for a New Millennium</i>, His Holiness the Dalai Lama first proposed an approach to ethics based on universal rather than religious principles. Now, in <i>Beyond Religion</i>, the Dalai Lama, at his most compassionate and outspoken, elaborates and deepens his vision for the nonreligious way. </p> <p>Transcending the mere \"religion wars\", he outlines a system of secular ethics that gives tolerant respect to religion, but, with the highest level of spiritual and intellectual authority, makes a claim for what the Dalai Lama calls a third way. This is a universal code of ethics that transcends religion boundaries, that recognizes our common humanity and advocates for a global human community based on understanding and mutual respect. </p> <p><i>Beyond Religion</i> is an essential statement from the Dalai Lama, a blueprint for all those who yearn for a life fulfilled and a better world.</p>";
