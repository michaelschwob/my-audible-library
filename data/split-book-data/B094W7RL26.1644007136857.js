window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Before Gary Clark Jr.’s first major-label album even debuted, the music world had already labeled him the rightful torchbearer of the blues. In his new Audible Original, <i>Deep Soul Lowdown</i>, the soft-spoken Texas guitar hero unpacks the gravity (and limitations) of such towering expectations as he recounts his astonishing life journey from teenage phenomenon to inheritor of the very mantle of his mentors.&nbsp;</p> <p>Combining intimate storytelling with seven of his most powerful tracks, including “When My Train Pulls In”, “Bright Lights”, and “This Land”, Clark reveals how an artist, firmly rooted in American musical tradition, has also succeeded in carving out his own unique path forward. Listen to the progression of a modern-day legend whose electrifying talent is matched only by his distinct authenticity.&nbsp;</p>";
