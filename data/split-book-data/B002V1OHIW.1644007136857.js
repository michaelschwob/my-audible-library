In Anthony Burgess' nightmare vision of the future, where the criminals take over after dark, the story is told by the central character, Alex, who talks in a brutal, invented slang that brilliantly renders his and his friends' social pathology. <p><i>A Clockwork Orange</i> is a frightening fable about good and evil, and the meaning of human freedom. When the state undertakes to reform Alex to \"redeem\" him, the novel asks, \"At what cost?\"</p> <p>This edition includes the controversial last chapter not published in the first edition, as well as Burgess' introduction, \"A Clockwork Orange Resucked\".</p>";
