window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The ethereal mists blurred Lucy Finnley’s vision, and the murmurings within the wind made her uneasy. However, she had no choice other than to leave the city and take up residence at the Jack Rabbit Inn on the high moor. As she stepped over the threshold, she was aware of the history, legends, and malevolent spirits lingering within the fabric of the building. At least she could escape the trouble brewing in the rest of the world.</p> <p>Down below, in the valley, lies Hawks Rise on the Moor. Here many secrets hide beneath the veil of respectability, and it is expected that everyone attends the church on Sundays where the Vicar shakes the still air with his sermons of damnation against the evils of an ancient tribe.</p> <p>Slipping back in time, Henry Mulberry, heir to Mulberry hall, views the moor through troubled eyes. He is responsible for huge swathes of land along with the tenants. Dealing with Irish squatters, a stone quarry, and mines are the least of his problems. The more pressing issues lie with his wayward younger brother Oscar, his irascible ailing father George, and Abbott Mathew. He has little time to pursue matters of the heart or any other desires.</p> <p>The hunt continues. Who will win the witches or the witchfinders?</p> <p>This book may be enjoyed as a stand-alone.</p>";
