window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>John Kennedy Toole - who won a posthumous Pulitzer Prize for his best-selling comic masterpiece <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i> - wrote <i>The Neon Bible</i> for a literary contest at the age of 16. The manuscript languished in a drawer and became the subject of a legal battle among Toole's heirs. It was only in 1989, 35 years after it was written and 20 years after Toole's suicide at 31, that this amazingly accomplished and evocative novel was freed for publication. </p>";
