window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the award-winning author of </b><b><i>The Book of Aron</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Phase Six</i></b><b> comes a powerful short story exploring one of the most devastating storms in American history. </b></p> <p>The 1935 Labor Day hurricane annihilated between four hundred and six hundred lives in the middle of the Florida Keys, and like all disasters, both exposed long-standing social and economic inequities and reminded us of the bonds that enable us to provide what rescue we can for those we cherish. In this fictional account of the storm, rooted in the record but brought to life with Shepardâ€™s unparalleled command of interpersonal impact, <i>Village of Islands</i> follows a handful of residents of a small beachside town in the moments leading up to, during and after this life-altering event.&nbsp;</p>";
