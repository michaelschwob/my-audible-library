window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This landmark collection is the definitive introduction to the Buddha's teachings - in his own words. The American scholar-monk Bhikkhu Bodhi, whose voluminous translations have won widespread acclaim, here presents selected discourses of the Buddha from the Pali Canon, the earliest record of what the Buddha taught. Divided into 10 thematic chapters, <i>In the Buddha's Words</i> reveals the full scope of the Buddha's discourses, from family life and marriage to renunciation and the path of insight. A concise, informative introduction precedes each chapter, guiding the listener toward a deeper understanding of the texts that follow. </p> <p><i>In the Buddha's Words</i> allows even listeners unacquainted with Buddhism to grasp the significance of the Buddha's contributions to our world heritage. Taken as a whole, these texts bear eloquent testimony to the breadth and intelligence of the Buddha's teachings, and point the way to an ancient, yet ever-vital path. Students and seekers alike will find this systematic presentation indispensable. </p>";
