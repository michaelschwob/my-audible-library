window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A pragmatic philosophy more popular than ever - here are 52 ancient lessons to help you overcome adversity and find tranquility in the modern world. </b></p> <p>An ancient belief system made new, Stoicism teaches us how to accept the things we cannot change and how to live a good life. It helps us improve our outlook, increase our well-being, and thrive in the face of adversity. But how does one live like a Stoic?&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>A Handbook for New Stoics</i>, renowned philosopher Massimo Pigliucci and practitioner Gregory Lopez guide listeners through 52 weekly lessons, each based on a common obstacle. Stressing out about a meeting at work? Try listing the things you can control and those you can’t. Epictetus writes: “In our power are thought, impulse, will to get, and will to avoid” - in other words, our own attitudes. Discover what you <i>can</i> control and quickly achieve peace of mind.&nbsp;</p> <p>Featuring quotes from philosophers, analysis by the authors, and journaling activities, these lessons enable listeners to reframe their perceptions and be happier.</p>";
