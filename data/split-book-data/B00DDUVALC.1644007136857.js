window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Buddhism has captivated many millions of people around the world, its vitality and adaptability enabling it to transform the civilizations of India, Southeast Asia, Tibet, China, Korea, and Japan, and also become a lively component in the cultures of Europe, Australia, and the Americas. But have you ever wondered how a religion that doesn't even have a god could have accomplished this? </p> <p>Now you have the opportunity to have your questions answered, as this series of 24 lectures by an award-winning teacher traces the history, principles, and evolution of a theology that is both familiar and foreign. </p> <p>You'll learn the astonishing story of Siddhartha Gautama - who was to become the Buddha, or \"enlightened one\" - the Indian prince who abandoned wife, son, and a privileged life to seek the meaning of life and death, and whose \"awakening\" and subsequent teachings have since impacted the world as few others have. </p> <p>And you'll learn what happened after his death, as his followers began to share his teachings about the \"Four Noble Truths\" and the \"Path\" to Enlightenment. You'll see how Buddhist beliefs underwent significant and even radical change, with different varieties of Buddhism having to take shape as those beliefs spread across India, Central Asia, China, Japan, and virtually every corner of the Western world, such as becoming more respectful of one's duties to family and ancestors in China or becoming reconciled with local deities in Japan.</p>";
