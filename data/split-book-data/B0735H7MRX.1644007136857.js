window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When first published to celebrate the 30th anniversary of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, <i>Live from New York </i>was immediately proclaimed the best book ever produced on the landmark and legendary late-night show. In their own words, unfiltered and uncensored, a dazzling galaxy of trail-blazing talents recalled three turbulent decades of on-camera antics and off-camera escapades. Now a fourth decade has passed - and best-selling authors James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales have returned to Studio 8H. They raucously and revealingly take the <i>SNL</i> story up to the present, adding a constellation of iconic new stars, surprises, and controversies. </p>";
