window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From acclaimed author Ursula K. Le Guin, and with an introduction by Karen Joy Fowler, a collection of thoughts - always adroit, often acerbic - on aging, belief, the state of literature, and the state of the nation.</p> <p>Ursula K. Le Guin has taken listeners to imaginary worlds for decades. Now she's in the last great frontier of life, old age, and exploring new literary territory: the blog, a forum where her voice - sharp, witty, as compassionate as it is critical - shines.</p> <p><i>No Time to Spare</i> collects the best of Ursula's blog, presenting perfectly crystallized dispatches on what matters to her now, her concerns with this world, and her wonder at it.</p> <p>On the absurdity of denying your age, she says, \"If I'm 90 and believe I'm 45, I'm headed for a very bad time trying to get out of the bathtub.\"</p> <p>On cultural perceptions of fantasy: \"The direction of escape is toward freedom. So what is 'escapism' an accusation of?\"</p> <p>On her new cat: \"He still won't sit on a lap. I don't know if he ever will. He just doesn't accept the lap hypothesis.\"</p> <p>On breakfast: \"Eating an egg from the shell takes not only practice, but resolution, even courage, possibly willingness to commit crime.\"</p> <p>And on all that is unknown, all that we discover as we muddle through life: \"How rich we are in knowledge, and in all that lies around us yet to learn. Billionaires, all of us.\"</p>";
