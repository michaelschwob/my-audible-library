One of the colonies, Rotor, has broken away from the solar system to create its own renegade utopia around an unknown red star two light-years from Earth: a star named Nemesis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Now a 15-year-old Rotorian girl has learned of the dire threat that nemesis poses to Earth’s people - but she is prevented from warning them. Soon, she will realize that Nemesis endangers Rotor as well.&nbsp;And so it will be up to her alone to save both Earth and Rotor as - drawn inexorably by Nemesis, the death star - they hurtle toward certain disaster.</p>";
