window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The daring, dazzling and highly anticipated follow-up to the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller </b><b><i>The Song of Achilles</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>One of the Most Anticipated Books of 2018 </b></p> <p><b>\"An epic spanning thousands of years that's also a keep-you-up-all-night page turner.\" (Ann Patchett) </b></p> <p>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child - not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring, like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power - the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.&nbsp;</p> <p>Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur; Daedalus and his doomed son, Icarus; the murderous Medea; and, of course, wily Odysseus.&nbsp;</p> <p>But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from or the mortals she has come to love.&nbsp;</p> <p>With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language and pause-resisting suspense, <i>Circe</i> is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, and love and loss as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man's world.</p>";
