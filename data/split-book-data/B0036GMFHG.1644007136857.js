window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Gambler</i> paints a stark picture of the attractions—and addictions—of gambling. Using skillful characterization, Dostoevsky faithfully depicts life among the gambling set in old Germany. This probing psychological novel explores the tangled love affairs and complicated lives of Alexey Ivanovitch, a young gambler, and Polina Alexandrovna, the woman he loves.</p> <p>Fyodor Mikhaylovich Dostoevsky (1821–1881) was born in Moscow, the son of a surgeon. Leaving the study of engineering for literature, he published <i>Poor Folk</i> in 1846. As a member of revolutionary circles in St. Petersburg, he was condemned to death in 1849. A last-minute reprieve sent him to Siberia for hard labor. Returning to St. Petersburg in 1859, he worked as a journalist and completed his masterpiece, <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, as well as other works, including <i>The Idiot</i> and <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>.</p>";
