window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"In classical Greece men called rhapsodes memorized and recited '<i>The Iliad</i>' and '<i>The Odyssey</i>.' My own rhapsode is the English actor Dan Stevens, whom fans of '<i>Downton Abbey</i>' will know as Matthew Crawley. Heâ€™s been performing the Robert Fitzgerald translation, and no Hellene could do it better.\" (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>)</p> <p>Robert Fitzgerald's translation of <i>The Odyssey</i> has been the standard translation for more than three generations of students and poets. Macmillan Audio is delighted to publish the first ever audio edition of this classic work, the greatest of all epic poems. Fitzgerald's supple verse is ideally suited for audio, recounting the story of Odysseus' long journey back to his wife and home after the Trojan War. Homer's tale of love, adventure, food and drink, sensual pleasure, and mortal danger reaches the English-language listener in all its glory.&nbsp;</p> <p>In keeping with the oral tradition of the time, Dan Stevens, whose many celebrated performances include <i>Downton Abbey's</i> Matthew Crawley, makes this epic tale come alive. The listener becomes totally immersed in the adventure and drama of the story - this is the way <i>The Odyssey</i> was meant to be experienced.&nbsp;</p> <p>Also included on the program is a portion of the poem read in ancient Greek so that listeners may experience the lyricism and music of the original language.&nbsp;</p>";
