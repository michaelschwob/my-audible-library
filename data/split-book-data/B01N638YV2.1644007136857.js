window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Embrace Hygge (pronounced <i>hoo-ga</i>) and become happier with this definitive guide to the Danish philosophy of comfort, togetherness, and well-being. </p> <p>Why are Danes the happiest people in the world? The answer, says Meik Wiking, CEO of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen, is hygge. Loosely translated, hygge - pronounced <i>hoo-ga</i> - is a sense of comfort, togetherness, and well-being. \"Hygge is about an atmosphere and an experience,\" Wiking explains. \"It is about being with the people we love. A feeling of home. A feeling that we are safe.\" </p> <p>Hygge is the sensation you get when you're cuddled up on a sofa, in cozy socks under a soft throw, during a storm. It's that feeling when you're sharing comfort food and easy conversation with loved ones at a candlelit table. It is the warmth of morning light shining just right on a crisp blue-sky day. </p> <p><i>The Little Book of Hygge</i> introduces you to this cornerstone of Danish life and offers advice and ideas on incorporating it into your own life, such as: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Get comfy. Take a break. </li> <li>Be here now. Turn off the phones. </li> <li>Turn down the lights. Bring out the candles. </li> <li>Build relationships. Spend time with your tribe. </li> <li>Give yourself a break from the demands of healthy living. Cake is most definitely hygge. </li> <li>Live life today, like there is no coffee tomorrow. </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>From picking the right lighting to organizing a hygge get-together to dressing hygge, Wiking shows you how to experience more joy and contentment the Danish way. </p>";
