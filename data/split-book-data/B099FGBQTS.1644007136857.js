window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Raphael and Renata Le Page, a brother and sister team, are hired to take a group claiming to be scientists up a remote mountain, where a plane has gone down with close to one billion stolen Euros onboard. Flown beneath radar detection, only a handful of people know of its existence. While the Le Page siblings are just doing the job they have been hired to do, the ruthless criminals are after the cash. The one thing none of them are counting on is that blood-thirsty beasts have roamed these mountains for thousands of years, and they'll ferociously protect their territory, devouring anyone who comes near.&nbsp;</p> <p>Climbing the mountain is tough. Getting down alive is going to be tougher.</p>";
