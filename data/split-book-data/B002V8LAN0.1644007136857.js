window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After spending four years in a Siberian penal settlement, during which time he underwent a religious conversion, Dostoevsky developed a keen ability for deep character analysis. In <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>, he explores human nature at its most loathsome and cruel but never flinches at what he finds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> tells the stirring tale of four brothers: the pleasure-seeking, impatient Dmitri; the brilliant and morose Ivan; the gentle, loving, and honest Alyosha; and the illegitimate Smerdyakov: shy, silent, and cruel. The four unite in the murder of one of literature's most despicable characters - their father. This was Dostoevsky's final and best work.</p>";
