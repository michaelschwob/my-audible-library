window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Soaring ambition. Unwavering integrity. Billie Joe Armstrong isn’t the first punk to negotiate mainstream success, but he might be its most undisguised example. In <i>Welcome to my Panic</i>, Green Day’s iconic front man holds nothing back as he tracks listeners though his deeply personal and artistic journey in raw detail.</p> <p>Matching his emotional storytelling with new, exclusive, recordings of Green Day’s biggest hits including “Basket Case”, “Good Riddance”, “Wake Me Up When September Ends”, and “American Idiot”, Armstrong chronicles the seminal moments in his life: the trauma and triumphs that have come to define him. As we listen, Billie Joe reminds us punk rock is not about how hard you can play but how hard you can remain yourself.</p>";
