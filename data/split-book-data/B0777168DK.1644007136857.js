What unfolds is a stirring romance between the asset and one of the janitors on staff, a mute woman who uses sign language to communicate with the creature.&nbsp;</p> <p>Developed from the ground up as a bold two-tiered release - one story interpreted by two artists in the independent mediums of literature and film - <i>The Shape of Water</i> weaves together fantasy, horror, and romance to create a tale that is equally gripping on the big screen and as an audio performance.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Prepare for an experience unlike anything you've ever heard or seen. </i></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your My Library section along with the audio.</b></p>";
