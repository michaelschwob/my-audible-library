window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal </i></b><b>bestseller. </b></p> <p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Jen Lancaster is here to help you chill the hell out.</b></p> <p>When did <i>USA</i> become shorthand for the United States of Anxiety? From the moment Americans wake up, we’re bombarded with all-new terrifying news about crime, the environment, politics, and stroke-inducing foods we’ve been enjoying for years. We’re judged by social media’s faceless masses, pressured into maintaining a Pinterest-perfect home, and expected to base our self-worth on retweets, faves, likes, and followers. Our collective FOMO, and the disparity between the ideal and reality, is leading us to spend more and feel worse. No wonder we’re getting twitchy. Save for an <i>Independence Day</i>-style alien invasion, how do we begin to escape from the stressors that make up our days?</p> <p>Jen Lancaster is here to take a hard look at our elevating anxieties, and with self-deprecating wit and levelheaded wisdom, she charts a path out of the quagmire that keeps us frightened of the future and ashamed of our imperfectly perfect human lives. Take a deep breath, <i>and</i> her advice, and you just might get through a holiday dinner without wanting to disown your uncle.</p>";
