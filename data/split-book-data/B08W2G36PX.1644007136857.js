It stars Neil Gaiman as... well, you know, and Jewel Staite (<i>Firefly</i>; <i>Stargate Atlantis</i>), and is written by Arvind Ethan David, executive producer of <i>Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency</i>.</p> <p><b>Please note: </b>Proceeds obtained by the producer from sales of this audio project will benefit This Is My Brave, a nonprofit organization that seeks to break the stigma of mental illness, alcoholism and substance abuse, sexual assault, eating disorders, and more through the power of live storytelling.</p>";
